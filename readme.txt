== Description ==
Custom Comment Notifications allows for the comment email notifications to be customized.  This way you can choose what information gets included in the e-mail and 
what information is left out.  You can make the e-mails as detailed or as minimal as you desire.  Through the use of some given variables, you are able to generate a 
standard e-mail template that will be dynamically generated and sent to your authors and moderators.  You can specify a separate template for your authors and another 
for you moderators.
